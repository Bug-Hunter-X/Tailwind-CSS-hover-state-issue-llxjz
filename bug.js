```javascript
// Example showing incorrect usage of Tailwind's hover pseudo-class
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Hover Me
</button>
// In this example the button will not change the background color on hover unless the parent element also has the hover state applied or another selector is being applied to the button
